**Turn your name (or any text!) into a unique, playable maze game!**

QR Maze Adventure is a fun web application that generates a QR code from the text you enter and then uses that QR code's pattern to construct a challenging maze for you to navigate.

## ü§î How It Works

1.  **Input:** You provide a string of text (e.g., "Pixel Explorer").
2.  **QR Generation:** The application uses the [Qrious.js](https://github.com/neocotic/qrious) library to generate a QR code representing that text. This QR code is displayed visually.
3.  **Maze Construction:** The core magic happens here! The application analyzes the pixel data (or module data) of the generated QR code. The black and white modules of the QR code are interpreted to define the walls and paths of the maze grid.
4.  **Rendering:** The maze is drawn onto an HTML Canvas element.
5.  **Gameplay:** JavaScript handles user input (keyboard events) to move a player character through the maze, checking for collisions with the walls derived from the QR code.
6.  **Sharing:** When you generate a maze, a unique URL can be created (potentially encoding the input text or maze data) that allows others to play the *exact* same maze.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** Structure of the web page.
*   **CSS3 & Tailwind CSS:** Styling and responsive design.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript:** Core application logic, DOM manipulation, game mechanics, and event handling.
*   **Qrious.js:** For generating QR codes dynamically on the client-side.
*   **HTML Canvas API:** For drawing and rendering the maze and handling game visuals.
*   **Font Awesome:** For icons.
